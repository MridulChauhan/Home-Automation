#ABSTRACT

1. The system intends at making life easy by providing the user with remote access to his household appliances using different types of sensors.
2. Ultrasonic sensor to design a touchless doorbell and a security system which could prevent unauthorized access inside a place.
3. DHT11 sensor to monitor the room temperature.
4. PIR motion sensor to have the appliances like lights,Lift lobby, All outdoor Lights, Common staircases, basement or covered parking area.
5. HC-05 to provide voice assistance to the user.
6. A system which could control door locks.
7. Remote user display of the various conditions using ThingSpeak cloud.

#APPLICATION
