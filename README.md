#ABSTRACT

The system intends at making life easy by providing the user with remote access to his household appliances using different types of sensors.
Ultrasonic sensor to design a touchless doorbell and a security system which could prevent unauthorized access inside a place.
DHT11 sensor to monitor the room temperature.
PIR motion sensor to have the appliances like lights,Lift lobby, All outdoor Lights, Common staircases, basement or covered parking area.
HC-05 to provide voice assistance to the user.
A system which could control door locks.
Remote user display of the various conditions using ThingSpeak cloud.

#APPLICATION

Ultrasonic sensor is used to improve security systems.
DHT11 temperature sensor can be used to measure temperature of different parts of house.
PIR motion sensors can also be used in security systems to catch burglars.
Smoke sensor for fire protection.
HC-05 Bluetooth module controls every device in the house wirelessly.
ThingSpeak cloud can be used for remote users.
